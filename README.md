Analysing network packets using Wireshark

Problem statement:
CS-349 Networks Lab
Assignment 2: Analysing network packets using Wireshark
Wireshark is a packet sniffer and network protocol analyzer tool. It helps to capture network packets and understands the
structure of different networking protocols.
Questions:
1.List out all the protocols used by the application at different layers (only those which you can figure out from traces).
Study and briefly describe their packet formats.

2.Highlight and explain the observed values for various fields of the protocols. Example, Source or destination IP address
and port no., Ethernet address, protocol number, etc.

3.Explain the sequence of messages exchanged by the application for using the available functionalities in the application.
For example: upload, download, play, pause, etc. Check whether there are any handshaking sequences in the application.
Briefly explain the handshaking message sequence, if any.

4.Explain how the particular protocol(s) used by the application is relevant for functioning of the application.

5.Calculate the following statistics from your traces while performing experiments at different time of the day: Throughput,
RTT, Packet size, No. of packets lost, number of UDP & TCP packets, number of responses received with respect to one
request sent. Report the observed values in your answer, preferably using tables.

6.Check whether the whole content is being sent from same location/source. List out the IP addresses of content providers,
if multiple sources exist and explain the reason behind this.
